# Weekly Notes
### Date: 8 July 2019 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped Kyle, a fellow REU student, with some resources for R. 

#### Who helped you this week?

Matt explained the stratification code to me a little more thoroughly and helped work through a bug in the code and Sam helped me figure out to get NaN values out of my code. The committee meeting with Andy and Kathy was very helpful. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Completed all plots for the stratification 
* Learned how to use Rmarkdown 
* Stayed on track for my project guidelines despite some set backs 
* Statistical analysis for primary stratification plots 


#### What did you struggle with?

* I spent too much time struggling trying to create a linear model from my stratification data, because it wouldn't create the lm from NaN values. To do this, I had to change my data from lists into tibbles and then replace the NaN values with NA. This process was long. I'm spending too much time on little R errors and not enough time producing results, but I'm still confident that I will find resources and enough help from colleagues to work through them. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Next week I plan to reorganize my stratification plots, focus on Buoy M, and create plots from other factors other than simply anomalies 
* I will begin making simple correlations and plotting zooplankton data and strat data together 


#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* I will need to check in early next week after making more stratification plots 

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* Nothing as of right now 

#### Any other topics

* Looking forward to presenting my UMASS research at the lab meeting! 



# Weekly Notes
### Date: 27 June 2019 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped Kyle, another REU intern on some R coding questions. I talked with Miguel and Lindsay about requirements for the Tukey HSD test, and we all figured out together some R coding details for that (must be set as factors). Outside of research, I helped Ellen and Margaret clean up from the BBQ.  

#### Who helped you this week?

Andrew and Lindsay helped me get back some missing plots 20 minutes before my meeting with Kathy. Turns out it was some mislabeling in code. Lindsay also helped me with a line of code "mutate" in order to determine decadal changes in zooplankton. Miguel helped me understand the statiscal differences between ANOVA and TUKEY HSD. Sam's R training course for all REU interns was extremely helpful! 

#### What did you achieve?

* Made time series line plots for yearly average anamolies, and all quarters 
* Learned how to do basic statistical analysis in R and applied it to my zooplankton    anamoly data to see if there is differences between decades 
* Finally figured out some details wit github, got set up on freedcamp and mendeley
* Entirely read through the lab's page on github 
* Gained a better understanding of decadal changes on callanus 
* Posted my first question on stack overflow 
* Completely finished the R training program that Sam provided 
* Attended my first lab meeting and first tidyverse thursday session 

#### What did you struggle with?

* I tried (too long) to make my line plots cleaner by adding a dashed line in between   misssing values. I posted on stack overflow to get some help and got some code that     worked, but I need to figure out a way to map it to each graph that I have 
* Trying to get the TUKEY HSD stats analysis to comply with my data, but we eventually   figured it out 
* Learning curve in figuring out how to successfully clone the github repository        branch

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Look into physical data 
* Determine correlations between stratification index and temperature, and strat index and salinity 
* Determine if I have to create a loop code (with help from Sam) to determine a stratification index, or if I can just use the code that Matt provided to me the beginning of last week 


#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* I want to make sure that I'm on the right track with my processing of both the biologial and the physical data. At this point I've spent more time on the biological data than I've allotted for myself, so I just want to make sure it's okay that I keep analyzing this instead of moving onto the physical data 

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* I may need help in making sure that I've cloned and pulled correctly from the tidyverse github repository 

#### Any other topics

* This lab seems extremely organized from what I can tell after reading the lab welcome sheet in github, and I'm grateful to have been placed in this lab out of all available at GMRI. I believe this is the best spot I could have been placed for my own advancement in R and statistical analysis 








# Weekly Notes
### Date: 13 June 2019 

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped Graham, another REU intern, with ideas on his proposal and how to format it. 

#### Who helped you this week?

Who didn't help me this week? Lindsay showed me Github, gave me R cheat sheets. Matt gave me the R scripts I'll be using for my research. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Completed research proposal with timeline 
* Got R scripts 
* Did most of my preliminary research for my project 

#### What did you struggle with?

* Technical writing in my proposal 
* Worried about catching on with R quickly enough 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Finish R training program 
* Process CPR data through R, try to see patterns


#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Nothing as of now, probably R things later 

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* R and tidyverse after I process this data set 

#### Any other topics

* Everyone has been so entirely welcoming, thank you!
