# Weekly Notes
### Date: 10 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

Mostly an isolated work week this week for me. Though, I did some experimenting tryng with Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box, which seems to be working and will hopefully be helpful when we have time to look over the example code/workflow as a lab, and participated in first round post doc interviews for Andy's NSF WARMEM project. 

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from Lindsay testing out the Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box workflow and from Alex K navigating some Mac file storage weirdness. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Edited Brian's COCA community report code to work with Brad's economics model results
* Produced example economic model results treemaps for Brad/Kathy to review
* Worked on COCA methods manuscript
* Proposed Box file organization structure
* Created an example vingette to show how to work with Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box
* Drafted professional development fund application materials
* Participated in post doc interviews
* Took some time for long-term strategizing

#### What did you struggle with?

* Writing -- there appears to be a trend here

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* **GET THE COCA METHODS PAPER DRAFT COMPLETED AND BACK TO KATHY**
* COCA seasonality manuscript
* Kathy and Andy meeting
* Have lab members up to speed on Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box work

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week: Kathy/Andy meeting, time to go over Git/GitHub and Kathy's review process of weekly progress documents
* Next two weeks: COCA methods draft reviews

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* More of the same help experimenting and finding solutions to lab software and workflow approaches as we all try to figure out how to work together as efficiently as possible.

#### Any other topics

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from the entire mills Lab while working through how to use Git/GitHub/RStudio projects to work collaboratively and from Alex K. on generating THREDDS URLS to access climate model projections.  

#### What did you achieve?

* Produced a collection of functions to collect and process physical oceanographic data from THREDDS servers, including OISST data and CMIP5 projections
* Drafted Git/Github/RStudio workflow slides and walked through collaborative coding example with Mills Lab
* Moved COCA methods paper and seasonality manuscripts along
* Worked on some Mills Lab management things (landing page, weekly meetings template)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Finding and sticking to focused writing time

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Re submit COCA methods paper to Kathy
* Wrap up COCA seasonality paper
* Lead Mills Lab meeting to recap GitHub progress/discuss next steps: Box file organization, function code-a-thon

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week: COCA methods paper, Job and planning (time on ME Sea Grant, NSF WARMEM, others?)

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* Guidance with Box file organization/priortizing what functions we might want to write as a lab/feed back on how all of these new things are working (FreedCamp, GitHub, Weekly-meetings markdown file updates)
