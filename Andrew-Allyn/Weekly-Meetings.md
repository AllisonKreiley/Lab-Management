# Weekly Notes
### Date: 6 June 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

This is an example of how you would do this on your own machine. Hopefully it works! Fill out your answers and then scroll down to the bottom of the page...

*Here is where you could add comments. Right now, I think this would show up as italics. But we could do something else...slight departure while I figure out block quotes in markdown...*

>Other option doing something like this?

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from a couple of people on different tasks. Miguel/Lindsay/Matt/Brian all helped me try to figure out what was going on with a weird coding issue. Brian also helped me out making some figures for the community report.

#### What did you achieve?

* COCA Stonington community report figures
* Code checking
* Moving most files over to Box
* FO paper review
* Lab management tidy tuesday

#### What did you struggle with?

* Time management with the COCA report figures. I always struggle with making figures and seem to spend hours just going back and forth between RStudio and viewing the output. I should look for opportunities to streamline this process and also maybe retstrict the actual time I dedicate to making figures -- otherwise it can zap entire weeks. 

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Lab management catch up (Tidy tuesday, FreedCamp, Git/GitHub weekly updates, slack channel)
* COCA MS discussion read through
* Joint Species Distribution Modeling work
* Future air temperature work

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week: COCA Methods MS review, Lab management stuff (FreedCamp, GitandGitHub for weekly comments)

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* Tidy tuesday!
* Check in on FreedCamp/Git and GitHub/Slack -- are folks using it? Why or why not? 

#### Any other topics

This space is yours to add to as needed.

#### Who did you help this week?

This week I helped out Brian working through the Stonington community report. I also helped Lindsay by providing a couple of papers and talking through measures of species distributions.

### Date: 17 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

I helped the lab go over a potential workflow that links Git/GitHub to RStudio Projects and GMRI's Box file management system. Everything *seems* to be working okay. 

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from the other people in the lab reviewing the potential workflow. I got help from Andy and Kathy with longterm planning. Karen also helped me with setting up some folders on Box.

#### What did you achieve?

* Progress on COCA methods MS. I lost about a day of work after a random Microsoft Word crash and having to find the most recent drafts amidst an unformatted text file -- lesson learned. Only going to be writing with google docs from here on out. I have about three paragraphs left, but it's definitely ready for some other eyes on it.
* COCA community report figures
* Reviewed example vingette with lab members that shows how to work with Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box
* Long-term strategizing with Kathy and Andy


#### What did you struggle with?

* Wait for it...writing and, specifically, the discussion of the COCA methods ms. I'm not sure why this is all too surprising, as I don't write that frequently. Moving forward, going to make time to practice writing at least a few times a week, rather than just waiting for a paper or proposal. I'd also really be interested in getting a writing workshop together to hear other people's approaches to writing.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* COCA seasonality manuscript
* Wrap up PD and long term planning stuff
* Distribute vingette to other lab members for Git/Github/Rstudio/Box
* Summer intern prep

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week: COCA Methods MS review, PD review, long term planning stuff, summer intern prep

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* More of the same help experimenting and finding solutions to lab software and workflow approaches as we all try to figure out how to work together as efficiently as possible.

### Date: 10 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?

Mostly an isolated work week this week for me. Though, I did some experimenting tryng with Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box, which seems to be working and will hopefully be helpful when we have time to look over the example code/workflow as a lab, and participated in first round post doc interviews for Andy's NSF WARMEM project. 

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from Lindsay testing out the Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box workflow and from Alex K navigating some Mac file storage weirdness. 

#### What did you achieve?

* Edited Brian's COCA community report code to work with Brad's economics model results
* Produced example economic model results treemaps for Brad/Kathy to review
* Worked on COCA methods manuscript
* Proposed Box file organization structure
* Created an example vingette to show how to work with Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box
* Drafted professional development fund application materials
* Participated in post doc interviews
* Took some time for long-term strategizing

#### What did you struggle with?

* Writing -- there appears to be a trend here

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* **GET THE COCA METHODS PAPER DRAFT COMPLETED AND BACK TO KATHY**

* Kathy and Andy meeting
* Have lab members up to speed on Git/GitHub/RStudio/Box work

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

* Next week: Kathy/Andy meeting, time to go over Git/GitHub and Kathy's review process of weekly progress documents
* Next two weeks: COCA methods draft reviews

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?

* More of the same help experimenting and finding solutions to lab software and workflow approaches as we all try to figure out how to work together as efficiently as possible.

#### Who helped you this week?

This week I got help from the entire mills Lab while working through how to use Git/GitHub/RStudio projects to work collaboratively and from Alex K. on generating THREDDS URLS to access climate model projections.  

#### What did you achieve?

* Drafted Git/Github/RStudio workflow slides and walked through collaborative coding example with Mills Lab
* Moved COCA methods paper and seasonality manuscripts along
* Worked on some Mills Lab management things (landing page, weekly meetings template)

#### What did you struggle with?

* Finding and sticking to focused writing time

#### What would you like to work on next week?
