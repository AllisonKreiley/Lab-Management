# Weekly Notes
### Date: 17 May 2019


#### What did you achieve?

* I finished the DataCamp on R markdown and several chapters of ggplot
* I started to make each r code page stand alone and incorporated the here package
* I read several papers on lobster and read the FO paper that we are reviewing a few times

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am trying to keep up with github and integrate it into my normal workflow

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* I am going to continue to read more about lobsters and do some exploratory data analysis on the phyiscal data in the GoMe

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

At the moment I think I am good with what I have and will continue to chug along

#### Who did you help this week?
I don't think I helped anyone

#### Who helped you this week?

Kathy during our meeting 
Kathy and Andy during the Lobster Collabrative meeting

#### What did you achieve?

* I incoorporated density into the update buoy function
* I succesfully ran and downloaded the OISST dataset and was able to create anomaly sst maps
* I finished writing a function to calculate and the temperature, salinity, or density anomalies for any buoy at any depth over several different time scales. 
* I also finished writing a function to calculate the stratification index anomalies.
* I incoorporated buoys N01 and M01 into the update buoys code

#### What did you struggle with?

* I struggled with adding N01 and M01 buoys to the code that downloads all of the buoy data at once. Those buoys have data for different depths than the other buoys and the current script doesn't allow variation in depth. I had to rewrite a buch of the code in order to add those buoys

#### What would you like to work on next week?

I am going to continue to work on the update buoy function to try and make it run a little faster. When I complete this I am going to combine the OISST and buoy data

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

At the moment I think I am good with what I have and will continue to chug along

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?
Possibly when I start working up the OISST data - I'll give it some more work first
#### Any other topics
