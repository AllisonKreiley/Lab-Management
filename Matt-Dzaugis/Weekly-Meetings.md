### Date: 10 May 2019

#### Who did you help this week?
I don't think I helped anyone

#### Who helped you this week?

Kathy during our meeting 
Kathy and Andy during the Lobster Collabrative meeting

#### What did you achieve?

* I finished incoorporating density into the update buoy function
* I succesfully ran and downloaded the OISST dataset and was able to create anomaly sst maps
* I finished writing a function to calculate and the temperature, salinity, or density anomalies for any buoy at any depth over several different time scales. 
* I also finished writing a function to calculate the stratification index anomalies.

#### What did you struggle with?

* I am currently struggling with adding N01 and M01 buoys to the code that downloads all of the buoy data at once. Those buoys have data for different depths than the other buoys and the current script doesn't allow variation in depth.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

I am going to continue to work on the update buoy function to include the M and N buoys. When I complete this I am going to combine the OISST and buoy data

#### Where do you need help from Kathy?

At the moment I think I am good with what I have and will continue to chug along

#### Where do you need help from other lab members?
Possibly with trying to add the M and N buoy into the updatebuoy function - I'll give it some more work first
#### Any other topics

This space is yours to add to as needed.
