# Welcome!
Welcome to Dr. Kathy Mills' Integrated Systems Ecology Lab at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute!

This repository contains a collection of documents and resources designed to support the development of individual lab members, and in doing so, create an open, effective and productive lab team.

# Getting started
## General information
* [Lab code of conduct](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management/blob/master/CodeOfCoduct.md)

## New lab members to do list
* GMRI new hire checklist
* Computer and email set up
* Get added to the lab email list and the GMRI quant group list serv
* Join lab slack channel 
* Register an account with [Freed Camp](https://freedcamp.com), make a personal group and then invite Kathy to an associated project (Professional Development)

# Meetings
## Individual meetings with Kathy
* This is a work in progress as we try to find scheduling options that work best for everyone.

## Weekly progress
* To keep everyone up to date on what other folks are working on in the lab, we will use [Kristie Whitaker's weekly meetings template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding). To use these Markdown files, fork the GMRI-SEL Lab Management repository repository. This should bring a copy to your private GitHub account. You can then update the Weekly-Meetings.md in your folder directly in GitHub. After making your changes, with a commit message that has the weekly date in the message. Finally, submit a pull request to the GMRI-SEL Lab Management repository. I *think* that after doing this you will want to make an upstream pull to the Lab account before submitting your next weekly meeting update -- this would presumably allow Kathy to comment directly in your weekly meetings file and then you would be able to see those comments?

## Group lab meetings
Lab meetings are scheduled for every other Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. For the late/spring summer, we will have lab meetings on 4/24, 5/8, 5/22, 6/5, 6/19, 7/3, 7/17, 7/31, 8/14, 8/28 in the Boulos (second floor) conference room. Andrew will send out a meeting reminder the morning of, which will also include information if you need to use zoom to connect remotely.

Have an idea for an upcoming lab meeting topic? [Add it to the list!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVWt2vhLGfHVYaQJkdCamAPiajUAa-xUM5aoaydEGGk/edit)
