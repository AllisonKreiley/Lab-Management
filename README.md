# Welcome!
Welcome to Dr. Kathy Mills' Integrated Systems Ecology Lab at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute!

This repository contains a collection of documents and resources designed to support the development of individual lab members, and in doing so, create an open, effective and productive lab team.

# Getting started

# Meetings
## Individual meetings with Kathy
This is a work in progress as we try to find scheduling options that work best for everyone.

## Weekly progress
We will use [Kristie Whitaker's weekly meetings template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) to keep Kathy (and everyone else) updated on what is going on in the lab, track our own progres, and build a stronger lab team. The idea with the weekly meetings markdwon file is to reflect on your work week, including who you helped, who helped you, what you accomplished, what you struggled with and what you need from Kathy or other lab members. Along with providing an update, ideally this process will support a strong, open and collaborative lab culture. Another benefit is it gives everyone time to celebrate the little victories, which can be easily overshadowed by the regular defeats that are so common in the scientific journey.

To use this system:
1. Fork the [GMRI-SEL Lab Management repository](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management) to make a copy on your own GitHub account.
2. In the terminal, make sure you are in the Lab Management directory on your local machine and then establish an upstream connection
>git remote add upstream https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management 
3. Using GitHub online (or a text editor if you prefer), navigate to the folder with your name and the associated Weekly-Meetings.md file. 
4. Edit the file, including the table of contents for your new weekly entry. Commit the changes as "Date-commit."
5. Submit a pull request to the lab and title the pull request: "LastName-Date."
6. Kathy will review and possibly add comments to the weekly entries <using Markdown block quotes. She will commit any comments as "MillsComments-Date."
7. Review your weekly entry and Kathy's comments and then pull these changes into your local, forked Lab Management repo using the terminal and entering
>git pull upstream master --ff-only
8. Complete the process by entering 
>git push
9. Make another weekly review edit and repeat the process, starting at step #4.
10. Have a look at other lab member's Weekly-Meeting.md files to see what everyone else is up to!

## Group lab meetings
Lab meetings are scheduled for every other Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. For the late/spring summer, we will have lab meetings on 4/24, 5/8, 5/22, 6/5, 6/19, 7/3, 7/17, 7/31, 8/14, 8/28 in the Boulos (second floor) conference room. Andrew will send out a meeting reminder the morning of, which will also include information if you need to use zoom to connect remotely.

Have an idea for an upcoming lab meeting topic? [Add it to the list!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVWt2vhLGfHVYaQJkdCamAPiajUAa-xUM5aoaydEGGk/edit)
