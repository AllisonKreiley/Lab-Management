# Welcome!
Welcome to Dr. Kathy Mills' Integrated Systems Ecology Lab at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute!

This repository contains a collection of documents and resources designed to support the development of individual lab members, and in doing so, create an open, effective and productive lab team.

# Getting started
## General information
* [Lab code of conduct](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management/blob/master/CodeOfCoduct.md)

## New lab members to do list
* Complete the GMRI new hire checklist with Kathy
* Send an email to [Andrew](aallyn@gmri.org) from your new GMRI email to get added to the lab email list and the GMRI quant group list serv
* Register your new email on slack and get added to the lab slack channel
* Register an account with [Freed Camp](https://freedcamp.com), make a personal group and then invite Kathy to an associated project (Professional Development)
* Register an account with [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/newsfeed) and get added to the lab Mendeley folders
* Set up a GitHub account and schedule a time to walk through the Git/GitHub/RStudio tutorial with Andrew

# Meetings
## Individual meetings with Kathy
This is a work in progress as we try to find scheduling options that work best for everyone.

## Weekly progress
We will use [Kristie Whitaker's weekly meetings template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding) to keep Kathy (and everyone else) updated on what is going on in the lab, track our own progress, and build a stronger lab team. The idea with the weekly meetings markdown file is to reflect on your work week, including who you helped, who helped you, what you accomplished, what you struggled with and what you need from Kathy or other lab members. Along with providing an update, ideally this process will support a strong, open and collaborative lab culture. Another benefit is it gives everyone time to celebrate the little victories, which can be easily overshadowed by the regular defeats that are so common in the scientific journey.

To use this system, here are step by step [directions](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management/blob/master/WeeklyMeetingsInstructions.md) as well as a [video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Q4M_P75o91jeMJiplhykZlJAgz9gTldv) capturing how I did this on my machine (with additional steps that Kathy would take to add comments to lab member's weekly updates).

## Group lab meetings
Lab meetings are scheduled for every other Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. For the late/spring summer, we will have lab meetings on 4/24, 5/8, 5/22, 6/5, 6/19, 7/3, 7/17, 7/31, 8/14, 8/28 in the Boulos (second floor) conference room. Andrew will send out a meeting reminder the morning of, which will also include information if you need to use zoom to connect remotely.

Have an idea for an upcoming lab meeting topic? [Add it to the list!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVWt2vhLGfHVYaQJkdCamAPiajUAa-xUM5aoaydEGGk/edit)

# Tidy Tuesday!
We will participate in the R for Data Science Tidy Tuesday effort to enhance our data manipulation and visualization skills and support lab collaboration. For more on this, check out the [Tidy Tuesday instructional page](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management/blob/master/TidyTuesday.md).
