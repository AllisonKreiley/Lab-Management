# Welcome!
Welcome to the GMRI Systems Ecology Lab run by Dr. Kathy Mills! 

This repository contains a collection of documents and resources designed to support the development of individual lab members, and in doing so, create an open, effective and productive lab team.

# Getting started
## General information
* Lab code of conduct

## To Do List
* Building orientation
* Computer and email set up
* Get added to the lab email list and the GMRI quant group list serv
* Join lab slack channel 
* Register an account with [Freed Camp](https://freedcamp.com), make a personal group and then invite Kathy to an associated project (Professional Development)

# Individual meetings with Kathy
* TBD. There are a couple options here and will likely depend on what works best for Kathy. One option would be updating a document that Kathy could review when she has time [following this template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding/blob/master/Setting-up-your-weekly-meetings.md), quick (15-30 minute check ins) each week, and one or two larger meeting time chunks (1-2 hrs?) that are assigned depending on what is most pressing.
