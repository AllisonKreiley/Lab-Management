# Welcome!
Welcome to Dr. Kathy Mills' Integrated Systems Ecology Lab at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute!

This repository contains a collection of documents and resources designed to support the development of individual lab members, and in doing so, create an open, effective and productive lab team.

# Meetings
## Individual meetings with Kathy
* This is a work in progress as we try to find scheduling options that work best for everyone.

## Weekly progress
* To keep everyone up to date on what other folks are working on in the lab, we will use [Kristie Whitaker's weekly meetings template](https://github.com/WhitakerLab/Onboarding). To use these files, take the following steps:
1. Fork the [GMRI-SEL Lab Management repository](https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management) to make a copy on your own GitHub account.
2. Establish an upstream connection by adding the lab as a remote by navigating to the correct directory in the terminal and entering 
>git remote add upstream https://github.com/GMRI-SEL/Lab-Management 
3. Navigate to the folder with your name and the Weekly-Meetings.md file. 
4. Edit the file, including the table of contents for your new weekly entry. Commit the changes as "Date-commit."
5. Submit a pull request to the lab and title the pull request: "LastName-Date."
6. Kathy will review and possibly add comments to the weekly entries <using Markdown block quotes. She will commit any comments as "MillsComments-Date."
7. Review your weekly entry and Kathy's comments and then pull these changes into your local, forked Lab Management repo using the terminal and entering
>git pull upstream master --ff-only
8. Complete the process by entering 
>git push
9. Make another weekly review edit and repeat the process, starting at step #4.
10. Have a look at other lab member's Weekly-Meeting.md files to see what everyone else is up to!

## Group lab meetings
Lab meetings are scheduled for every other Wednesday from 1:00 - 2:00. For the late/spring summer, we will have lab meetings on 4/24, 5/8, 5/22, 6/5, 6/19, 7/3, 7/17, 7/31, 8/14, 8/28 in the Boulos (second floor) conference room. Andrew will send out a meeting reminder the morning of, which will also include information if you need to use zoom to connect remotely.
